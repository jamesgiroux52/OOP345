This week the topics that were covered were using command line arguments and internal and external linkage of variables. We also used dynamic memory for the food description.

I had no issues with this workshop because I understood these concepts from last semester in OOP244.

Command line arguments are essential in programming, especially for console/terminal apps. In this workshop, we passed filenames to the program, including an invalid filename which is handled in the code provided in main(). I don't have much else to say; it is a simple concept to understand, especially being proficient in command-line applications like Unix.

With variable linkage, we have two keywords that were used in this workshop, extern and static. 
Extern variables are similar to global variables in the sense that they are accessible throughout the life of the program. They are defined in a module header and instantiated in the module's implementation file.
Static variables are defined in a function scope, but the instantiation only happens once. These are very useful for keeping track of the number of times a function has been called. We used it in this workshop as a counter for line items and increased it every time the display function was called. Static and extern keywords can also be used in conjunction with custom types, functions, and class members.

When upgrading part one to use dynamic memory, I initially forgot the rule of three, but I quickly realized that mistake and fixed it. 

A nice easy one to get started. Looking forward to the next.
