// Workshop 6 Reflection
*************************************************************/

- manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL
- move a dynamically allocated object into a container
- code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container
- report and handle an exception

This workshop was a lot of work, especially because of studying for the midterm and not starting it until the end of study week. 
That being said I did not have any problems with the containers (ie vectors, lists, and their iterators). My main confusion was 
with refreshing my knowledge of classes in a hirearchy.

I had some issues with my output at first because I was adding new lines in Student, Professor, and Employee. But then I remembered that
the caller (College) should always handle the new lines and my problem was resolved quickly.

The select function in College was surprisingly easy, but it felt really good to get some more practice with passing logic to a function.

Thanks again for your help, it seems that it is usually for something small, but it is very much appreciated none the less.
