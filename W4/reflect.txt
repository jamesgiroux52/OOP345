*************************************************************/

In this week's workshop we learned about different relationships between classes i.e. Composition and Aggregation and we learned how to work with double pointers.

I had a bit of trouble with memory management in the ConfirmOrder module, but once you explained it to me it became more clear.
The Child module is a composition because it manages everything to do with Toy while ConfirmOrder has an aggregation relationship with Toy.
Composition relationships manage the objects creation and deletion, while aggregation relationships does not manage the resource, but both retain ownership of the Toy** member. Composition makes copies and needs to delete them but aggregation does not.
The concept of a pointer to an array of pointers took some getting used to, but I think that biggest thing I learned was the relationships between classes and how to manage them when they are dynamically allocated.
Thanks for the help professor!
